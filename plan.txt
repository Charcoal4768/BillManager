FUNCTIONALITY:

Signup/Login Pages, mobile-first, simple, friendly 
material-ish design
UI should be modern but also printer-friendly, not too much shading

Let a user create one or more stores

Make an editable bill at the store's adress with the selected products (+/-/delete button next to each product).
If a product in the bill has its Quantitiy reduced to 0, remove that product
Have an add more products button at the end where you can search products by name
